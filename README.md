## Abstract

Technology is almost the only power in the process of human civilization that can achieve superimposed progress. History may repeat, but technology will always move forward. The vision of the Internet is interconnected, decentralized and discrete. However, due to the rise of distributed computing, the Internet has become more and more centralized. As the era of blockchain 3.0 approaches, blockchain application can go far beyond the scope of finance, expanding many fields such as identity authentication, justice, audit, logistics, medical care, energy, etc., becoming the lowest level protocol of the future Internet. However, most of the current Data is stored in the cloud server cluster of central enterprises. Data verification and supervision become the most resource-consuming and complex problems to solve when Data is stored in a third party that is not fully trusted. At the same time, when the information resources are aggregated on the distributed computing platform, problems like platform monopoly, opaque operation, data loss, data untrustworthiness and privacy leakage, and Blockchain development will be significantly restricted.

CNFS (Computer Network File System) is the world's first secure, controllable and content-addressable peer-to-peer hypermedia distribution protocol. It aims to provide content-based addressing services, replace HTTP protocol clusters, connect and integrate storage and computing resources. Besides, it offers open, fair and manageable distributed storage services. Relying on the CNFS protocol system builds a distributed storage cluster with high throughput, provides limited centralized distributed storage services and builds the next generation of the civil, political, and commercial integrated license-free chain.

CNFS consists of a new set of Internet application layer protocols for modern Internet resources and facilities, a redefined cloud services, edge computing, Blockchain, data distribution, data fusion and distributed storage. It's the world's first blockchain technology protocol that provides controllable risk, complete life cycle security and privacy protection, high storage scalability, high data compatibility and high data computing efficiency.

## Technology and Industry Overview
### 1.1 Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology is the next generation of disruptive technology after the steam engine, power and Internet. If the steam engine has released people's productivity, the power has solved people's basic living needs, and the Internet has completely changed information transfer methods. As a machine designed for trust, the Blockchain may completely change the value transfer of the whole human society. The significance of Blockchain is that it can build a more reliable internet system and fundamentally solve the fraud and rent-seeking phenomenon in value exchange and transfer. With the popularization of blockchain technology, the digital economy will be more authentic, and the economic society will become fairer and more transparent.

As the birthplace of Internet technology, the United States has invested heavily in blockchain technology and applications. In 2017, at least eight states in the United States proposed bills to stimulate the development and application of blockchain technology. In February 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives held two consecutive hearings on Blockchain to explore new applications of blockchain technology. The U.S. state department emphasizes that blockchain technology can improve transparency and solve corruption, fraud. The U.S. Treasury is conducting pilot programs to determine whether blockchain technology can be used for the supply chain management. It has also taken measures to improve relevant laws on "anti-money laundering / combating terrorist financing (AML / CFT)" based on cryptocurrency and formed public-private partnerships (PPPs) with financial institutions to share information. South Burlington, Vermont, will utilize blockchain technology to record real estate transactions. California legislators have submitted a bill that the state's electronic records law should admit blockchain signatures and smart contracts. New York State Power Company TransActiveGrid proposed a new P2P distributed micro electric network based on Blockchain. Through the Blockchain, a microgrid network will be established to improve the utilization rate of clean energy. The remaining electricity is recorded on the Blockchain and can be sold to neighboring users through smart contracts.

In January 2016, the U.K. government released a report called "Distributed Ledger Technology: Beyond Blockchain". The report points out that blockchain technology has great potential in changing public and private services. In addition to creating a public platform based on Blockchain to provide services for the whole people and society, the British government also plans to develop a system that can be a bridge between the government and public institutions. The Japanese government strongly supports blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency industry and has established the first blockchain industry organization - Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) and blockchain cooperation. Russia is vigorously promoting the construction of blockchain infrastructure. Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, cooperates with the government to transfer and save files with Blockchain, which has become a real application case of Blockchain. Canada has a vast blockchain entrepreneurial community, which brings together many top blockchain talents, including Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum. The Canadian Securities Regulatory Commission (CSA) recently launched a new "Fintech Sandbox" program to promote Canada's blockchain industry development.

Blockchain technology originated from the open-source community and has grown fast in the community. Since then, it has gradually attracted the attention of financial institutions, I.T. giants and other institutions. For example, open-source projects represented by Bitcoin and CNFS mainly focus on Public Blockchain, creating a public platform for Blockchain; Hyperledger, launched by the Linux Foundation in 2015, focuses on Consortium Blockchain technology. At the same time, IBM, Microsoft Azure, AWS and other I.T. giants are trying their best to build the infrastructure supporting blockchain applications, Blockchain as a Service (BaaS).

In recent years, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and other Institutions and many developed countries have released a series of reports on Blockchain to explore blockchain technology and its applications. At present, the application of blockchain technology has gone beyond the financial field and gradually in the supply chain, credit reference, identity authentication, charity, Internet of things and many other areas. Since 2012, the number of global blockchain enterprises has increased at a compound growth rate of more than 65.2%. An optimistic forecast is that by 2025, 10% of global GDP will be stored using blockchain technology. According to the estimation of DMR, the scale of the blockchain industry is expected to reach 20 billion U.S. dollars by 2024.

The core concept of Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger, which is composed of an encryption algorithm, consensus mechanism, smart contract and other technologies. It integrates multiple isolated databases and stores thin nodes variously in a distributed way jointly maintained by numerous nodes; due to decentralization, tamper proof and traceability, Blockchain is widely used in many fields, such as the financial industry, medical treatment and supply chain. The combination of Blockchain and decentralized storage brings us plenty of opportunities and possibilities. In the past decades, the centralized storage scheme has made significant contributions to the development and popularization of the Internet. However, with the development of the Internet and the advent of big data, the volume of Data is growing exponentially. Faced with the challenge of massive data storage, the traditional centralized storage system has exposed various drawbacks, such as data concentration, the poor security and so on, which cannot meet the current storage needs. At present, both traditional centralized storage and optimized distributed storage still have many disadvantages.

- **(1) Insufficient storage space and high cost**

   The Internet cloud storage service is developing rapidly, and many service providers begin to seize the market. With the advent of big data, the Data is overgrowing, and the centralized storage space is limited. To provide users with sufficient storage space, cloud storage service providers need to buy many servers for continuous operation and maintenance, and the cost is very high. Service providers invest a lot of money to purchase cloud storage services per year, but the profit model of cloud storage services is not mature. Many users tend to use free services, and it is challenging to provide profits for enterprises. In the long run, likely, service providers will not bear substantial economic losses and eventually lead to the termination of their operations.

- **(2) The bandwidth is limited, and the transmission distance is long**

   Data is increasing rapidly every day in the big data era, but the efficiency of the central system is low. Centralized storage needs to upload all data to the main server for processing. The load of the central server is enormous. The massive data storage and transmission process have brought significant challenges to the bandwidth of the central servers. Because of the bandwidth limitation, and the centralized servers are usually located in remote areas far away from the actual users, data transmission speed is slow, and it is challenging to meet users' needs.

- **(3) Poor storage security**

   When using centralized servers to provide data storage services, data centralization is a severe core problem. Centralized servers are often concentrated in one or more places. Once power failure occurs, lots of related businesses will be paralyzed. In addition, the centralized server sometimes accepts massive request-response of data storage, which may lead to a system crash in the peak period. Once the server fails, users will bear the risk of complete loss of data information. In addition, due to the centralized storage of data in the central servers, they are primary targets of hacker attacks. The security of data storage is hard to guarantee.

- **(4) Lack of privacy protection**

   With the continuous expansion of the cloud storage market, the number of its users is also overgrowing. Because the services are convenient, fast, and easy to lose, more and more users like to upload their photos, videos, and other types of files to the network storage. However, the data privacy issues are also worthy of vigilance. User data is stored on the server provided by the cloud storage service provider and managed by the administrator employed by the service provider, who can directly view and delete almost all the files uploaded by users, which may cause user privacy disclosure problems. At the same time, due to artificial intelligence development, some companies are also driven by profits that may steal user data to train neural network algorithms. Although there are rules and regulations to restrict these behaviors, it's challenging to solve user privacy leakage.

   Massive data has become the most valuable asset but also requires more advanced data storage methods. With the emergence of blockchain technology, the concept of decentralization has gained the broad approval of the people. At present, a new data storage management technology suitable for non-trust scenarios is urgently needed, that is, a decentralized storage scheme. Therefore, distributed storage based on Blockchain has become an inevitable trend.

- **(5) Supervision of decentralized distributed storage is difficult**

   Unlike traditional centralized systems, decentralized distributed storage has the characteristics of P2P and joint participation, which ensures the freedom and privacy of participants. Taking Blockchain as an instance, all participants are equal in rights and obligations, and there are no third-party organizations to manage them. Once the content is stored in the Blockchain, it is difficult to tamper with. However, there are also some disadvantages because it leads to a lack of supervision. There may be someone maliciously spreading some illegal files in the platform, which is difficult to delete, making the network a hotbed of illicit data storage.

### 1.2	Market Prospect

The birth and popularization of the Internet have stimulated the rapid development of information technology, making modern society from the industrial age to the information age.

The evolution of the times has brought great convenience to human life. However, the ubiquitous application of information technology has also led to the explosive growth of data. According to IDC statistics, the total amount of global data generation exceeded 1zb in 2010, reached 33zb in 2018, and exceeded 175zb in 2025. With the advent of the era of data explosion, many technological innovations, such as distributed computing, big data and artificial intelligence, have been fully developed; Simultaneously, the explosive growth of data also brings significant challenges to information processing technology. How to effectively store, compute and transfer big data with 5V characteristics is the focus of the new generation of information technology.

Data storage is the primary problem in information processing, which provides the basis for computation and transfer. With the growth of data volume, availability, I / O capacity and other requirements of services and applications, the storage system is also evolving, from the early direct connection mode to the network mode, then the distributed storage mode in recent years. Traditional centralized storage has the advantages of high reliability, good stability and ease to use. However, the explosive growth of data also exposes some defects, such as low horizontal scalability, high cost and poor connectivity between different systems. It is easy to form a data island, which leads to the high cost of data center management and maintenance. The distributed storage mode is to store the Data on several independent devices (using standard servers instead of expensive professional devices) in the network and manage it by running storage software to form a whole to provide storage services.

Nowadays, global data storage and data computing are facing a subversive revolution from centralization to distribution. Many tech giants take the lead in the layout of new technologies. The market related to distributed technologies shows a rapid development trend. The future development prospect of the distributed data storage and data computing industry is promising.

### 1.3	Existing Problems

**Security**
Blockchain is born for security, but also undertakes security threats. Security threat is one of the most critical issues that Blockchain has faced so far. Blockchain is facing the challenges of algorithm security, protocol security, usage security, implementation security, and system security from the analysis.

**Privacy**
The traditional distributed storage architecture does not consider the privacy leakage problem in the process of data collection. In general, the perceptual data collected by mobile users, such as real-time location, personal health data and identity information, are usually sensitive information. Submitting these data to the data center in plaintext will inevitably cause a potential severe danger of privacy leakage.

**Scalability**
Consensus mechanism, broadcast communication, data encryption, and decryption algorithm optimization cannot solve the scalability problem of the large-scale decentralized system; The lightning network and state channel are the solutions executed out of the chain, which is contrary to the concept of blockchain decentralization and cannot be widely used due to the complicity use and bad user experience. Traditional blockchain storage has very low scalability.

**Efficiency**
Fog computing technology reduces the pressure of the core network, has lower network delay, and runs much fast; The mobility of storage is very suitable for the Internet of things, online games, and data transmission because the storage cost can be significantly saved. Moreover, considering data storage redundancy, various solutions such as cloud storage are based on distributed low-cost redundant structures and high-speed storage based on memory in the existing centralized architecture. Compared with the need for global copy, the implementation cost of the ecological solution is meagre.

**Cost**
The existing schemes do not consider the data access control problem in the process of range query. In real life, different end-users often correspond to other accessible datasets, and specific users are generally only allowed to search in their authorized datasets. However, embedding data access control in the scope search of spatial data under ciphertext will increase the complexity and cost of the model.

## CNFS Project Introduction
### 2.1	Technology Overview 

CNFS consists of a new set of Internet application layer protocols for modern Internet resources and facilities, a redefined cloud services, edge computing, Blockchain, data distribution, data fusion and distributed storage. It’s the optimal solution under the condition of the modern Internet. By integrating the P2P network, distributed hash table (DHT), data encryption and fragmentation, IPFS network protocol, multichain incentive mechanism, block exchange and other technologies, a distributed storage network dispersed, which forms a new computing paradigm and cooperation mode in an untrusted competitive environment with meager cost, and it provides high quality and low-price file storage service for the world. QEDB quantum database is built based on CNFS blockchain nodes. CNFS protocol supports the creation of fully distributed applications. It aims to construct a network file system under the supervision of security nodes where users can upload, store, and share files freely in a distributed way. The technical architecture of CNFS is shown in Figure 1

CNFS consists of more than one protocol, just like TCP/IP consists of a four-layer protocol stack model. It includes five protocols: storage layer protocol, distributed network resource management protocol, storage content retrieval protocol, distributed computing protocol and blockchain application management protocol. As shown in Figure 2

The CNFS resource management layer allocates the computing power of the whole network, removes unstable computing power according to algorithms, makes real-time statistics, reports adequate computing power, and provides solutions for the dynamic release and management of contract services. The supervisor node in the CNFS resource management layer scans the real-time operation status of the whole network, eliminates equipment with problems, improves the score of the equipment with good resource status, and ensures the network resources highly available all the time.

The distributed storage layer uses the distributed storage protocol to realize the distributed database, which is in physical distribution and logical unification, guarantees the data atomicity and consistency, and satisfies the distributed database of blockchain fragmentation extension. Moreover, the distributed database retrieves data based on the content hash, ensuring the authenticity and reliability of the distributed data and improving inspection and audit speed quality. The optimized distributed hash table technology is used to record the file's metadata to achieve the file addressing function, realizing the content-based addressing or data block based addressing in the distributed data network.

The distributed computing layer dynamically allocates computing tasks to the edge network nodes to realize distributed computing. It will dynamically select the computing nodes that meet the requirements of the neighboring nodes to form a temporary computing cluster and perform the computing tasks. The service providers will not need to maintain the computing nodes themselves or consider the node selection problem. Different services can share the same computing equipment, dramatically reducing the maintenance cost and increasing general efficiency.

The blockchain application management layer aims to realize the cross-chain interconnection of many heterogeneous blockchain applications and form a distributed blockchain application network with interconnection, interoperability and mutual trust based on massive data. Through multichain ecological consensus, the connection between decentralized blockchain platforms is realized, the atomicity of cross-chain operation is solved, and the value exchange of multichain ecology on the CNFS platform is realized. For different ecological applications, multiple Dapps are built based on the multichain blockchain structure to realize the trusted value exchange on the chain. It’s a trustful distributed application trading platform with a transparent transaction process, whole chain supervision, disintermediation, and data privacy protection. The central currency trusteeship is eliminated. The consensus mechanism of group supervision and management plan is adopted. The smart contract is executed automatically to form an autonomous community with independent value interaction.

### 2.2	Distributed Storage
**Mimicry architecture for metadata services**

Metadata node is a high-risk target in the distributed storage system, which is the preferred target for attackers regarding the difficulty of implementation and the benefits. Similarly, from the perspective of defenders, if we can protect metadata services through the CMD security mechanism, we can get the maximum-security benefits; In terms of protection cost, we need to pay extra cost and performance overhead for heterogeneous redundancy. Therefore, if metadata service is designated as pseudo protection boundary, it can significantly reduce the cost and the load pressure of agent and has better realizability. At the same time, for the protection of data nodes, the DHR structure could be optional. Based on existing block redundancy, heterogeneity is introduced to enhance the storage security of physical data blocks.

CNFS lab designed Mimic-HDFS architecture for metadata services. To reduce the complexity of design and implementation while ensuring compatibility with the original system, Mimic-HDFS still uses the essential node functions and interaction process of HDFS, as shown in Figure 3. 

Aiming at the security problems in the current distributed storage systems, we introduce a dynamic, heterogeneous and redundant security mechanism to enhance the system's defense capability against vulnerabilities and Backdoors. Firstly, we analyze the main threats and attack methods the distributed storage systems face, locates their "core weakness, " and proposes a specific security construction method based on the cost and effectiveness of protection.
