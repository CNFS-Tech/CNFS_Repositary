## Brief summary
The CNFS project aims to improve the internet and the state of data storage of the internet users. The CNFS project aims to construct a network file system under the supervision of security nodes where users can upload, store, and share files freely in a distributed way.
  
CNFS, short for Cluster Network File System, introduces a new combination of Internet application layer protocols, which include an integrated peer-to-peer network, a distributed hash table, data encryption and fragmentation, CNFS network protocol, multichain incentive mechanism, block exchange and other technologies.
This unique combination of technologies makes CNFS a flexible technology. CNFS supports high-quality, low-cost file storage for the whole world, quantum databases and fully distributed applications. 
  
CNFS will tackle some of the common, yet critical problems related to data storage which includes security, privacy, scalability, efficiency and cost by using a five layered storage protocol.

## CNFS Technologies 
**CNFS as distributed storage:**
- heterogeneity is introduced to enhance the storage security of physical data blocks 
- uses the essential node functions and interaction process of HDFS 
- need to pay extra cost and performance overhead for heterogeneous redundancy

## CNFS as distributed computing:
- Executes tasks as system generated and user generated
- Tasks are executed using a smart contract system

## CNFS as an AI miner:
- Supports GPU mining through NVIDIA CUDA architecture
- Supports parallel card mining
- Supports earning of three kinds of income

## CNFS DAPP development:
- the ledger and payment function of Blockchain is still the core component of the system 
- sharing computing power will become a condition 
- current smart contract is not enough for the decentralized A.I. application 

## CNFS Cross-chain invocation:
- Split into three chains: transaction chain, file operation chain and file storage main chain
- Main Chain has many branches, divided by file type
- File operation chain records the query, transfer and other operations of the file in the storage location
- Transaction chain records the token information

## CNFS Consensus Mechanism:
- Adopt the oracle proof of work (OPoW) mechanism
- OPoW requires significantly less computing power than conventional consensus mechanisms
- OPoW soleves the problem of unequal mining power

## CNFS Token mechanism:
- Uses the mixed exponential reward mechanism
- 85% 10 billion CNFS tokens (CNX) will be allocated as mining rewards.
- CNFS ecosystem members need to stake certain CNX tokens
